# Action Framework

A development methodology that ensures design and testing are not skipped. The action-lite system provides a practical file-based implementation of this methodology.

## Core Methodology

### Phases

#### 1. Discovery (Divergent)
- Gather user requirements
- Add specifications if not already present
- Allow thought process to branch out and expand
- Explore the problem space

#### 2. Design (Convergent)
- Bring all ideas together
- Design is baked into the action
- Cannot be skipped like in Scrum
- Create explicit design before implementation

#### 3. Implementation
- Build according to design
- Follow the specifications

#### 4. Testing
- Verify implementation against Statement of Specifications
- If testing fails → cycle back to Discovery or Design
- Guaranteed test phase (not optional)
- Comprehensive verification ensures quality

The testing phase validates that all specifications are met. Unlike traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) which starts with tests, action-lite establishes specifications during Discovery and verifies during Testing. This approach combines:
- **Specification-driven verification**: Each specification item must pass
- **TDD principles**: Systematic testing, fast feedback, cycle-back on failure
- **Quality guarantee**: Testing cannot be skipped

Testing validates:
- Functional correctness (does it work as specified?)
- Technical requirements (right technologies, patterns, standards?)
- Performance criteria (meets speed, capacity requirements?)
- Quality attributes (accessibility, security, maintainability?)

**Test-first thinking in action-lite**:
- Discovery phase: Define what must be tested (specifications)
- Design phase: Design for testability, specify verification approach
- Implementation phase: Build to meet specifications
- Test phase: Verify all specifications independently
- Cycle back if any specification fails

For comprehensive TDD guidance and how TDD principles integrate with action-lite, see the [TDD Integration Guide](./references/tdd-integration-guide.md).

#### 5. Documentation
- Capture the analysis of impact
- Document what was learned
- Record how the implementation affects the system

#### 6. Publishing
- Deploy changes or make available for use
- Final release step

### Comparison with Scrum

| Aspect | Scrum | Action |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Design | Optional, can skip | Built-in, required |
| Testing | Not defined, optional | Guaranteed phase |
| Failure | Can one-shot a PBI even if flawed | Forces cycle back on failure |

### Key Insight

The Action cycle will force you back to Discovery or Design if implementation or testing fails. Since design is not optional, you cannot complete an action and later discover the design was flawed without addressing it.

### Divergent vs Convergent Thinking

- **Divergent (Discovery)**: Branching out, expanding possibilities
- **Convergent (Design)**: Bringing together, narrowing to solution

Sometimes setting aside specific time for divergent activities as their own work item is necessary to populate the backlog. Backlog refinement is a convergent flow and requires a divergent thinking step to align items.

## Action-Lite: File-Based Implementation

Action-lite is a practical file-based task tracking system that implements the Action methodology. It uses acyclic directed meta-graphs to track task dependencies and requirements.

### File Structure

Actions are stored in a main directory structure:
- Each action is a markdown file with the title as the filename
- Meta-graph dependencies are stored in a directory sharing the action's name
- A meta-graph directory can exist without an associated action file

**Example Structure:**
```
actions/
├── Feature Authentication.md
├── Feature Authentication/
│   ├── Research OAuth providers.md
│   ├── Design token storage.md
│   └── Implement login flow.md
└── Bug Fix Database Connection.md
```

### Tagging System

Each action file must include the following tags at the top:
- `#action` - Identifies this as an action file
- `#(state)` - Current state (discovery, design, implementation, test, document, publish, published)
- `#(project-name)` - Project identifier for grouping
- `#priority` - Optional, marks important actions (remove when completed)

**Example:**
```markdown
#action #design #authentication-system #priority
```

### Action File Sections

Each action file contains these sections (denoted by `#` markdown headers):

#### 1. Notes
General notes on the task, context, and observations.

#### 2. Statement of Action
The task to be performed, more in-depth than the title. Should include why the action is needed and what problem it solves.

#### 3. Statement of Inputs
A markdown bullet list of dependencies using `.md` links to other action files or wiki links.

**Example:**
```markdown
# Statement of Inputs
- [Research OAuth providers](./Feature%20Authentication/Research%20OAuth%20providers.md)
- [Design token storage](./Feature%20Authentication/Design%20token%20storage.md)
```

#### 4. Statement of Specifications
Requirements and constraints that must be met. This section is critical for testing phase.

#### 5. Statement of Design
One or more output/design pairs:

**Format:**
```markdown
# Statement of Design

## Output: [what will be produced]

#### Design
[Detailed design for how to proceed]

## Output: [another output if applicable]

#### Design
[Another design section]
```

#### 6. Analysis of Impact
How the implementation affects the system, what was learned, and any side effects or considerations for future work.

### State Progression

Actions progress through these states. State tags may be updated at any point in the file:

1. **discovery** - All actions start here
   - **Outputs**: Title, Notes, Statement of Action, Statement of Inputs, Statement of Specifications

2. **design** - Design phase
   - **Outputs**: Statement of Design

3. **implementation** - Follow design to completion
   - Build according to specifications and design

4. **test** - Verification phase
   - Go back to design if tests fail
   - Verify against Statement of Specifications

5. **document** - Documentation phase
   - **Outputs**: Analysis of Impact

6. **publish** - Deployment/release
   - Make changes available

7. **published** - Completed and available for use
   - Final state

### Meta-Graphs and Dependencies

Meta-graphs represent task hierarchies and dependencies:
- Create a directory with the same name as an action file to create a meta-graph
- Store dependent actions inside this directory
- Dependencies form an acyclic directed graph (no circular dependencies)
- Use Statement of Inputs to link to prerequisite actions

This structure allows you to:
- Break complex actions into smaller, manageable sub-actions
- Track which actions must be completed before others
- Maintain clear dependency chains
- Organize related work hierarchically

### Working with Actions

**Creating a new action:**
1. Create a markdown file with a descriptive title
2. Add tags: `#action #discovery #project-name`
3. Fill in Notes and Statement of Action
4. Identify inputs/dependencies
5. Add specifications

**Progressing an action:**
1. Update the state tag as you move through phases
2. Complete required outputs for each phase
3. If testing fails, update state back to `#design` or `#discovery`
4. Remove `#priority` tag when action is completed

**Creating dependencies:**
1. Create a directory matching the action filename
2. Create sub-action files inside this directory
3. Reference sub-actions in the parent's Statement of Inputs

### Best Practices

- Actions can remain uncompleted indefinitely - no artificial time pressure
- Only add `#priority` tag when truly important, remove after completion
- Use descriptive filenames that clearly identify the action
- Keep Statement of Action focused on the "what" and "why"
- Make specifications testable and concrete
- Update state tags as soon as phase changes occur
- Use meta-graphs to break down complex actions into manageable pieces
- Maintain acyclic dependency graphs - no circular references

#### Testing Best Practices
- Write testable specifications during Discovery phase (concrete, measurable, unambiguous)
- Design with testability in mind (specify how verification will occur)
- Verify each specification independently in Test phase
- Use the Verification Agent for objective assessment
- Cycle back to Design for implementation issues, Discovery for specification issues
- Document verification approaches in Statement of Design
- Consider test automation where appropriate
- Think about testing in every phase, not just Phase 4
